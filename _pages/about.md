PD Dr. Christian L. Althaus is a computational epidemiologist and head of the [Interfaculty Platform for Data and Computational Science (INPUT)](https://www.ispm.unibe.ch/research/research_groups/input/index_eng.html) at the [Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM)](https://www.ispm.unibe.ch) at the [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch) at the University of Bern, Switzerland. He is also a member of the directorate of ISPM.

After studying biology at ETH Zurich (Switzerland), Dr. Althaus received his doctorate in theoretical biology at Utrecht University (The Netherlands). In 2017, he qualified as a university lecturer at the University of Bern medical faculty in the field of infectious disease epidemiology. He uses mathematical and computational modeling in combination with data analyses to investigate how the health of populations and the population biology of infectious diseases are affected by environmental changes and public health interventions. Dr. Althaus is an expert for emerging infectious diseases and has made major contributions to the better understanding of the transmission dynamics of Ebola, MERS, and COVID-19. He is a member of the [Multidisciplinary Center for Infectious Diseases (MCID)](https://www.mcid.unibe.ch) at the University of Bern and served as a member of the [Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force](https://sciencetaskforce.ch) in 2020.
