I am a research group leader in computational epidemiology at the [Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine](https://www.ispm.unibe.ch) at the [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch), Switzerland.

My research concerns how the population biology of infectious diseases is affected by environmental changes, dynamic patterns of host immunity, or public health interventions. Key areas of my research are emerging infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance and sexually transmitted infections.
